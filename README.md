# tabs2tana

Saves the tabs open in the current window as a set of Tana nodes onto the clipboard in tana-paste format.

# Installing without building
If you just want to use this extension without bothering with the source code and all that jazz, you can download the latest `release.zip` file from the `Releases` area (right hand side of the github project page). Then, go to the Chrome extension manager (`chrome://extensions`) and turn on `Developer mode`. This will give you access to the `Load unpacked` button and you can pick the downloaded zip file.

# Building from source
To bootstrap this git repo into Chrome locally, first clone the repo.
Then run `npm install` and `npm run build`. 
Go to Chrome extension manager, turn on Developer mode and `load unpacked` the `dist` directory.

The format used on the clipboard is very simple:

```
%%tana%%
- Tab Workspace #workspace
  - Title of site #website
    - Description:: <from site metadata>
    - Url:: <of open tab>
```
